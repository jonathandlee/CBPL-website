# Cbpl

This repository acts as both a hub for contribution and a way to visualize the progress of the website. [A static version of the current release version of the website can be accessed at this link](https://jonathandlee.github.io/CBPL-website/CBPL-website/), which is a great way to visualize our current progress and features. 

## Contributing

For those new to angular development, the typical readme contents with information on getting started with angular development, testing, etc are listed below. The codebase is structured as follows:
The `main` branch is the development branch that you will want to clone for development purposes. From there, you can use node project manager `npm install` to install necessary dependencies, and view a development server version of the website using `ng serve`. Once you are satisfied with changes, make a pull request. 
The `build` branch exists for the purposes of easy viewing of a static version on github pages. It is not recommended to make any changes to build; that's something I'll handle.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
